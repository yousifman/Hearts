# Hearts
Fully functioning Hearts card game written in Java

My final project for CSC 116 - Intro Computer Programming.
The focus of this project was object-oriented design.

***NOTE:* The HeartsGUI and Hearts classes were provided by the teaching staff and were not created by me**
**Every other class was solely implemented by me**
